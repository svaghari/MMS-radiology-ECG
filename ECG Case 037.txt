ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION
Main Abnormalities
This ECG is diagnostic of the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome:
*Sinus rhythm with a very short PR interval (< 120ms). https://litfl.com/pr-interval-ecg-library/
*Broad QRS complexes. 
*Delta waves = slurred upstroke to the QRS. https://litfl.com/delta-wave-ecg-library/
Other Features:
*Dominant S wave in V1 — this “type B” pattern indicates a right-sided accessory pathway. 
*Tall R waves and inverted T waves mimic the appearance of LVH — this is an electrical phenomenon due to WPW and not a sign of ventricular hypertrophy. https://litfl.com/left-ventricular-hypertrophy-lvh-ecg-library/
*ST segments and T waves show typical “discordant” changes — they point in in the opposite direction to the QRS complex, similar to LBBB. https://litfl.com/left-bundle-branch-block-lbbb-ecg-library/
