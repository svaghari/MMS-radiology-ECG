ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION
Main Abnormal Findings
*Severe bradycardia of 36 bpm. https://litfl.com/sinus-bradycardia-ecg-library/
*Rhythm is difficult to ascertain — appears irregular (?slow AF) although there are some small-voltage P waves seen in V1-2. 
*Broad QRS complexes with an atypical LBBB morphology. https://litfl.com/left-bundle-branch-block-lbbb-ecg-library/
*Subtle symmetrical peaking (“tenting”) of the T waves in V2-5. 
Diagnosis
The combination of bradycardia, flattening and loss of P waves, QRS broadening and T wave abnormalities is highly suspicious for severe hyperkalaemia. This patient had a potassium of 8.0 in the context of anuric renal failure.

CLINICAL PEARLS
When you see the combination of…
*Bradycardia 
*Blocks — e.g. AV block, bundle branch blocks 
*Bizarre QRS complexes 
…. think hyperkalaemia!
