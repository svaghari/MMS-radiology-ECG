ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION
This is a tricky ECG!
There is evidence of atrial fibrillation, as evidenced by the irregular baseline with fibrillatory waves most prominent in V1-2.
NB. Fibrillatory waves are characteristically seen in V1-2 (which overlie the atria), as opposed to tremor artefact which may be in seen in multiple leads without a predominance for V1-2. 
However, the ventricular rhythm is regular. How can this be? AF is irregular by definition…
This is an example of “regularised AF” due to digoxin toxicity:
*The underlying rhythm is AF, which is being treated with digoxin. 
*There is complete heart block, prevent atrial impulses from reaching the ventricles. https://litfl.com/av-block-3rd-degree-complete-heart-block/
*There is an accelerated junctional rhythm maintaining cardiac output. https://litfl.com/accelerated-junctional-rhythm-ajr/
If this all seems like too much of a coincidence, then consider the pathophysiology of digoxin toxicity…

CLINICAL PEARLS
Digoxin toxicity produces a wide variety of dysrhythmias, due to:
*Increased automaticity of atrial, junctional and ventricular tissues — via actions at the Na/K and Na/Ca exchangers causing increased intracellular calcium and therefore increased spontaneous depolarisation of cardiac pacemaker cells. 
*Decreased AV conduction — via increased vagal tone at the AV node. 
Digoxin toxicity produces some combination of:
*Increased atrial automaticity — especially atrial tachycardia, but also atrial ectopics, AF, flutter. https://litfl.com/premature-atrial-complex-pac/
*Increased junctional automaticity — especially accelerated junctional rhythms. https://litfl.com/accelerated-junctional-rhythm-ajr/
*Increased ventricular automaticity — frequent VEBs and bigeminy, polymorphic VT. https://litfl.com/premature-ventricular-complex-pvc-ecg-library/
*AV blocks — including 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree AV block. https://litfl.com/first-degree-heart-block-ecg-library/
Characteristic ECG patterns include:
*Atrial tachycardia with high-grade AV block (= the classic dig-toxic rhythm). https://litfl.com/ecg-case-030/
*Regularised AF =  AF with complete heart block + accelerated junctional escape rhythm, producing a paradoxically regular rhythm. https://litfl.com/digoxin-toxicity-ecg-library/
*Bidirectional VT = polymorphic VT with QRS complexes that alternate between left- and right-axis-deviation, or between LBBB and RBBB morphology. https://litfl.com/bidirectional-ventricular-tachycardia-bvt-ecg-library/
NB. Digoxin toxicity should not be confused with digoxin effect (= “sagging” ST depression and T-wave inversion in patients on therapeutic doses of digoxin; not predictive of toxicity). 
Clinical Pearls 
*Check for tremor artefact before you start diagnosing regularised AF! 
*If the ECG pattern appears genuine and the clinical picture is compatible with digoxin toxicity (GI upset, xanthopsia, current digoxin treatment), then check an urgent digoxin level.
