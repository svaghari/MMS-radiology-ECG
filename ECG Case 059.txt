ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION
Main Abnormalities
*Sinus rhythm with frequent ventricular ectopics in a pattern of ventricular bigeminy. https://litfl.com/premature-ventricular-complex-pvc-ecg-library/
*Grossly prolonged QT interval (> 600 ms). 
*“R on T” phenomenon is present, with each VEB falling on the end of the T wave — this ECG pattern is very high risk for deterioration to torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation. https://litfl.com/polymorphic-vt-and-torsades-de-pointes-tdp/
*Relatively short PR interval and possible delta waves (leads I, II, V6) are suggestive — but not diagnostic — of WPW syndrome. https://litfl.com/delta-wave-ecg-library/
*Voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy are present in multiple leads. https://litfl.com/left-ventricular-hypertrophy-lvh-ecg-library/
This patient had suffered a cardiac arrest in the context of severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and long QT syndrome.
(NB. ~1/3 of patients with HOCM will have some evidence of WPW on their ECG).
---------------
Can you guess what happened next?
The patient had a further TdP cardiac arrest!
This was treated with IV magnesium and potassium, with restoration of sinus rhythm.
This interesting case is discussed in Cardiovascular Curveball 003
