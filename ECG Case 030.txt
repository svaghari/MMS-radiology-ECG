ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION
Main Abnormalities
*Atrial tachycardia, with regular P waves visible at ~ 160 bpm (many of the P waves are hidden within T waves and VEBs). https://litfl.com/atrial-tachycardia-ecg-library/
*Evidence of high-grade AV block — there is a 4:1 conduction ratio between P waves and QRS complexes, with a QRS rate of ~ 40 bpm. https://litfl.com/av-block-2nd-degree-high-grade-av-block/
*Frequent ventricular ectopic beats occurring in a pattern of ventricular bigeminy. https://litfl.com/premature-ventricular-complex-pvc-ecg-library/
*Alternating LBBB and RBBB morphology, with the conducted QRS complexes demonstrating RBBB morphology (RSR’ in V1) and the VEBs demonstrating LBBB morphology (dominant S wave in V1). https://litfl.com/right-bundle-branch-block-rbbb-ecg-library/

Diagnosis
The combination of…
*Atrial tachycardia 
*Frequent ventricular ectopic beats 
*High-grade AV block 
… is almost pathognomonic of severe digoxin toxicity.

CLINICAL PEARLS
ECG Features of Digoxin Toxicity
Digoxin toxicity produces a wide variety of dysrhythmias, due to:
*Increased automaticity of atrial and ventricular tissues — via actions at the Na/K and Na/Ca exchangers causing increased intracellular calcium and therefore increased spontaneous depolarisation of cardiac pacemaker cells. 
*Decreased AV conduction — via increased vagal tone at the AV node. 
Digoxin toxicity therefore usually produces some combination of:
*Increased atrial automaticity — especially atrial tachycardia, but also atrial ectopics, AF, flutter. https://litfl.com/premature-atrial-complex-pac/
*Increased ventricular automaticity — frequent VEBs and bigeminy, polymorphic VT. https://litfl.com/premature-ventricular-complex-pvc-ecg-library/
*AV blocks — including 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree AV block. https://litfl.com/first-degree-heart-block-ecg-library/
Characteristic ECG patterns include:
*Atrial tachycardia with high-grade AV block (= the classic dig-toxic rhythm). https://litfl.com/digoxin-toxicity-ecg-library/
*“Regularised AF” =  AF with complete heart block + accelerated junctional escape rhythm, producing a paradoxically regular rhythm. https://litfl.com/digoxin-toxicity-ecg-library/
*Bidirectional VT = polymorphic VT with QRS complexes that alternate between left- and right-axis-deviation, or between LBBB and RBBB morphology. https://litfl.com/bidirectional-ventricular-tachycardia-bvt-ecg-library/
NB. Digoxin toxicity should not be confused with digoxin effect (= “sagging” ST depression and T-wave inversion in patients on therapeutic doses of digoxin; not predictive of toxicity).
