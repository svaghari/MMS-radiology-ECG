ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION
Main Abnormalities
*Sinus tachycardia ~ 100 bpm. 
*Anterior T wave abnormalities: inverted in V1-3, biphasic in V4. 
*Inferior T wave abnormalities: biphasic in III, aVF. 
*Subtle ST elevation in III and aVF. 
Significance of ECG Findings
This pattern of T wave inversions in the right precordial leads V1-4 plus the inferior leads (especially the rightward-facing lead III) is referred to as the right ventricular strain pattern. It is a marker of right ventricular hypertrophy or dilatation.
Diagnosis
In a patient presenting with acute shortness of breath, the combination of…
*Sinus tachycardia 
*RV strain pattern in V1-4 (+/- lead III) 
… is highly suggestive of acute cor pulmonale due to massive pulmonary embolism.
However, these ECG changes are not specific to PE and may be seen in other conditions associated with pulmonary hypertension and RV enlargement including:
*Chronic lung disease (COPD, lung fibrosis) with chronic cor pulmonale https://litfl.com/ecg-in-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/
*Right ventricular hypertropy — e.g. due to congenital causes, valvular heart disease https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-hypertrophy-rvh-ecg-library/
*Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy https://litfl.com/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-arvc/

CLINICAL PEARLS
Other ECG findings associated with pulmonary embolism include:
*New right axis deviation https://litfl.com/right-axis-deviation-rad-ecg-library/
*New right bundle branch block https://litfl.com/right-bundle-branch-block-rbbb-ecg-library/
*New dominant R wave in V1 https://litfl.com/r-wave-ecg-library/
*Non-specific ST segment changes 
The oft-quoted SI QIII TIII  pattern (deep S wave in lead I, Q wave in III, inverted T wave in III) is neither sensitive nor specific for PE and is infrequently seen (20% of cases).
Similarly, sinus tachycardia is not as ubiquitous in PE as people seem to think (< 50% of cases), and certainly should not be relied up to exclude PE.
