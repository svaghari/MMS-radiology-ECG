ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION
This pattern of deeply inverted T waves in the anterolateral leads V2-6, I and aVL is characteristic of Wellens syndrome.
*This ECG pattern is highly predictive of a significant occlusive lesion of the LAD. 
*The inverted T waves are a marker of reperfusion and may occur after an aborted anterior STEMI. https://litfl.com/anterior-myocardial-infarction-ecg-library/
*Despite often being pain free and having normal cardiac enzymes at presentation, these patients are at risk of sudden LAD re-occlusion leading to massive anterior STEMI and are best managed with early angiography and PCI / CABG.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
A similar pattern of deep anterolateral T-wave inversions may also be seen with:
*Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy – suspect if associated LVH https://litfl.com/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-hcm-ecg-library/
*Raised intracranial pressure – patient will be comatose (see Quiz ECG 012) https://litfl.com/raised-intracranial-pressure-ecg-library/
